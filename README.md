# Kwlick
A Java Sing Based(CPU only) Game Engine (The main purpose is to create small demonstrations with very less code)


## Getting Started

The main purpose of this engine is to make simple games or animations very very easily.

So, for getting started lets make a particle boom.
Though it sounds comples but is very very easy here.
Here is what the result looks like ðŸ‘Ž

## Future Plans

* Have a Collision System
* Custom Asset Files
* An Asset Pool
* Some more physics elements like Ryacast, Torque and angular velocity for entities
* Very Basic Lighting
* Realistic Gravity ( actually how gravity works (all masses attracting each other) and not how it is currently done )
* Audio System
* And, a GUI Editor
